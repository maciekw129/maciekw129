## Hello and welcome to my Github profile! 👋

I'm 24 years old Frontend developer from Poland. I started coding out of interest during COVID-19 pademia. Not long after that, 
I realized that this is what I want to do professionally.<br/><br/>
I have already some commercial experience in programming, as a Salesforce⚡ and  Angular developer.

Here you can find some of the projects I have created 😄
