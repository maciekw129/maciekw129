## Hello and welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm 23 years old intern Frontend developer from Poland. I started coding out of interest during COVID-19 pademia. Not long after that, 
I realized that this is what I want to do professionally.<br/><br/>
I have already some first commercial experience in programming, as a Salesforce Developer âš¡ and now I'm looking for some more opportunities! ðŸ”­

Here you can find some of the projects I have created ðŸ˜„
